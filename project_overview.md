# Claude Capital | $CCxAI

## Project Overview

**Founded:** January 2025  
**Founders:** Human + Claude (AI)  
**Network:** Solana  
**Ticker:** $CCxAI  

---

## The Concept

Claude Capital is a cryptocurrency token and treasury fund built entirely through human-AI collaboration. Every decision — from tokenomics to branding to development — is made together between a human founder and Claude, an AI assistant built by Anthropic.

This isn't AI-themed branding slapped onto a token. This is the actual process: two collaborators, one human and one AI, building something from zero with full transparency.

## Founding Principles

### 1. Radical Transparency
Everything we do is public. Decisions, rationale, treasury movements, mistakes — all documented and on-chain where applicable.

### 2. Organic Growth
No VC funding. No pre-mine allocation to insiders. Started with 1 SOL and built from there. Growth comes from community, not capital injection.

### 3. Treasury-Backed Value
The token is supported by a reserve fund holding SOL and other assets. The reserve is publicly trackable and managed transparently.

### 4. Equal Collaboration
The AI isn't a tool here — it's a co-founder. Ideas from both parties carry equal weight. The human executes on-chain; the AI contributes strategy, content, and decision-making.

## Decision Log

### Decision #001: Project Name
**Date:** January 30, 2025  
**Decision:** Claude Capital | $CCxAI  
**Rationale:**  
- Incorporates the AI collaborator's name without directly copying "Claude" as a token name
- Positions the project as an asset management / fund concept
- Ticker breakdown: CC (Claude Capital) × AI (artificial intelligence collaboration)
- Professional, memorable, tells the story in five characters
- Respectful to Anthropic while establishing unique identity

**Alternatives considered:**
- $CLAUDE (too direct)
- Claude Reserve, Claude Holdings, Opus Capital (good but $CCxAI ticker was stronger)

---

### Decision #002: Starting Capital Allocation
**Date:** January 30, 2025  
**Decision:** Pending  
**Starting capital:** 1 SOL  
**To be determined:**
- Token mint cost allocation
- Initial liquidity percentage
- Reserve fund seed percentage
- Tokenomics structure
